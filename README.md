## 🤖 My AI Usage

### Which AI Tools I Used
I used **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code extension) throughout the development process.

### How I Used AI

**Backend Development:**
- Generated TypeScript interfaces and Express route handlers
- Created JWT authentication middleware (`protect`, `adminOnly`)
- Implemented CRUD operations for sweets management
- Suggested proper error handling patterns and HTTP status codes

**Frontend Development:**
- Generated React component structures with hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Auto-completed Tailwind CSS utility classes for responsive design
- Created form validation logic for registration and login
- Implemented shopping cart context with localStorage persistence
- Suggested modern UI patterns like auto-sliding hero carousel

**Problem Solving:**
- Debugged TypeScript compilation errors
- Resolved React re-rendering issues in useEffect hooks
- Helped configure Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite

### Reflection on AI Impact

**Positive Impacts:**
- **Speed**: Accelerated development by 50-60%, especially for boilerplate code
- **Learning**: Discovered TypeScript and React best practices through Copilot suggestions
- **Consistency**: Maintained uniform coding patterns across the project
- **Problem-Solving**: Quickly resolved configuration and syntax issues

**Challenges:**
- Had to review AI suggestions carefully as some didn't match my project structure
- Some suggestions had subtle bugs requiring manual debugging
- Business logic and security configurations required manual implementation

### Example Commit with AI Attribution

```bash
git commit -m "style: Improve product card UI

Used AI to suggest Tailwind utility classes for layout and spacing,
then adjusted colors and responsiveness manually.
